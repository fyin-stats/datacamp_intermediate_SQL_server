### Chapter 1 -- Summarizing Data

#### Data Exploration with Economics

MIN()
MAX()
AVG()

<!-- WHERE State <> "NY" -->

<!-- GROUP BY State -->

<!-- HAVING Count(CustomerID) >10 -->

<!-- ORDER BY Count(CustomerID) DESC -->

Having is the WHERE for Aggregations

#### Dealing and Resolving missing data

NULL, IS NULL, IS NOT NULL

WHERE IS NULL

BLANK is not NULL

use where LEN(GDP) > 0, ISNULL

ISNULL(column1, column2)

COALESCE(column1, column2, 'N/A')

#### Changing column values with CASE

CASE WHEN THEN [ELSE] END, [] means optional

or


### Chapter 2 - Math functions

#### Counting and totals

SELECT COUNT(*) FROM Incidents
DISTINCT

GROUP BY
ORDER BY
DESC

#### Math with Dates

DATEPART, DD, MM, YY, HH

DATEADD(DATEPART, number, date)

what date is 30 days from June 21, 2020?

DATEDIFF(DD, '2020-05-22', '2020-06-21')

can use FORMAT(getdate(), 'dd-MM-yy') function to transform dates


#### Rounding and Truncating numbers
Rounding numbers in T-SQL, ROUND(number, length [,function])

Rounding numbers in T-SQL

ROUND(,0)
ROUND(,1)

Rounding on the left side of the decimal, use negative numbers

TRUNCATING : ROUND(,0,1), the third argument here corresponds to the operation

#### More math functions
ABS()
SQRT()
SQUARE()

LOG(number [,Base])

LOG(0, 10) will give you an error

### Processing Data in SQL Server

#### While loops

define variables, 
VARCHAR(n): variable length text field
INT:
DECIMAL(p,s): p, number of decimals to be stored to the left of the decimal point; s, number of decimals to be stored to the right of the decimal point

NUMERIC(p,s):

DECLARE @Snack VARCHAR(10)
SET @Snack - 'Cookies'
SELECT @Snack

While loops in T-SQL

DECLARE @ctr INT

SET @ctr = 1

WHILE @ctr < 10
  BEGIN 
    SET @ctr = @ctr + 1
    IF @ctr = 4
      BREAK
  END

SELECT @ctr


DECLARE @counter INT
SET @counter = 20

-- Create a loop
WHILE @counter < 30

-- Loop code starting point
BEGIN
	SELECT @counter = @counter + 1
-- Loop finish
END

-- Check the value of the variable
SELECT @counter


#### Derived table

break down complex queries into small pieces

#### Common Table expressions (CTE)

WITH CTEName(Col1, Col2) AS (

SELECT
FROM

)


### Chapter 4 - Window function

Window syntax in T-SQL

OVER (PARTITION BY SalesYear ORDER BY ) AS

COUNT(CurrentQuota) OVER ()

<!-- SELECT OrderID, TerritoryName,  -->
<!--        -- Total price for each partition -->
<!--        SUM(OrderPrice) -->
<!--        -- Create the window and partitions -->
<!--        OVER(PARTITION BY TerritoryName) AS TotalPrice -->
<!-- FROM Orders -->


#### Common window functions

FIRST_VALUE() OVER (PARTITION BY ORDER BY )
LAST_VALUE()


query adjacent rows
LEAD(), last value will always be null for LEAD()
use ORDER BY to determine

LAG(), first value will always be zero


<!-- SELECT TerritoryName, OrderDate,  -->
<!--        -- Specify the previous OrderDate in the window -->
<!--        LAG(OrderDate)  -->
<!--        -- Over the window, partition by territory & order by order date -->
<!--        OVER(PARTITION BY TerritoryName ORDER BY OrderDate) AS PreviousOrder, -->
<!--        -- Specify the next OrderDate in the window -->
<!--        LEAD(OrderDate)  -->
<!--        -- Create the partitions and arrange the rows -->
<!--        OVER(PARTITION BY TerritoryName ORDER BY OrderDate) AS NextOrder -->
<!-- FROM Orders -->

#### Increasing window complexity

creating a running total with ORDER BY
SUM() OVER (PARTITION BY ORDER BY)

ROW_NUMBER(), requires order by

<!-- SELECT TerritoryName, OrderDate,  -->
<!--        -- Assign a row number -->
<!--        ROW_NUMBER() -->
<!--        -- Create the partitions and arrange the rows -->
<!--        OVER(PARTITION BY TerritoryName ORDER BY OrderDate) AS OrderCount -->
<!-- FROM Orders -->


#### Using window function for statistical functions

Calculating stdev for all
STDEV() OVER() AS StandardDev

Calcuating stdev for each partition
OVER(PARTITION BY ORDER BY)


Calculating the mode, CTE, row number, sub query

<!-- This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>. -->

<!-- When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this: -->

<!-- ```{r cars} -->
<!-- summary(cars) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- ## Including Plots -->

<!-- You can also embed plots, for example: -->

<!-- ```{r pressure, echo=FALSE} -->
<!-- plot(pressure) -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot. -->
